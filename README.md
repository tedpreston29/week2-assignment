writing the functions were tricky as I have still not quite got my head around it. I and may not have been able to do this without a bit of guidance from google.

need to figure out positioning of thumbnails and images... images... nearly there, just need to make main image to the size of screen

Images and thumbnail bar adjusted... I might change the size of the main image display to fit the screen, depends on how it looks. also changed scroll-bar colour to fit the theme I am going for...

need to add buttons and look at adding media queries for mobile view...

added buttons that loop through index... also added arrow key function (left and right arrow keys on keyboard)...

Changed the styling with media queries so that mobile users will have a better experience.

added aria-label to buttons.

I found this assingment quite tricky. I definitely need to work on JS callback functions, I get how they work but when it comes to writing one myself I forget the flow of their mechanics and struggle quite a lot.

the styling section was fun and it is more intuituive and visual so I can see what is working and what isn't easier than in javascript. I'll get revising callback functions asap!
